# Midterm_Project (Flight Prediction Delays)

This project predict arrival delays of commercial flights using te data from air travel industry. Often, there isn't much airlines can do to avoid the delays, therefore, they play an important role in both profits and loss of the airlines. 
It is critical for airlines to estimate flight delays as accurate as possible because the results can be applied to both, 
improvements in customer satisfaction and income of airline agencies.

There were four separate tables:

     - flights: The departure and arrival information about flights in US in years 2018 and 2019.
     - fuel_comsumption: The fuel comsumption of different airlines from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month.
     - passengers: The passenger totals on different routes from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month.
     - flights_test: The departure and arrival information about flights in US in January 2020. This table will be used for evaluation. For submission, we are required to predict delays on flights from first 7 days of 2020 (1st of January - 7th of January). 

We used these approach: 
 - Supervised Learning
 - Feature Engineering
 - Sampling
 - Data Visualization
 - Using APIs for data enhancements
 - JSON parsing
 - JDBC connection to a database
